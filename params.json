Download from GitHub - `git clone https://github.com/srcoley/gits.git`\r\n1. Change directory to gits - `cd gits`\r\n1. Source the installation file - `. install.sh`\r\n\r\n### Manual\r\n\r\nSee: [What Does The Install File Do?](#what-does-the-install-file-do)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to run gits:\r\n\r\n1. `gits <repo name>` - This methos performs a search via the `api.github.com/legacy/repos/search` endpoint. Once the repo owner/name of the first result has been determined, it gets cached and gits gets ran again using the second method below.\r\n1. `gits <repo owner>/<repo name>` - This method clones directly from `https://github.com/<repo owner>/<repo name>.git`, skipping the search and the cache.\r\n\r\n## For the Initated\r\n\r\n### What Does The Install File Do?</h3>\r\n\r\nTwo things:\r\n\r\n* Moves gits' files to ~/.gits\r\n* Adds `. ~/.gits/gits.sh` to the end of your .bash_profile file\r\n\r\n### The \"Cache\"\r\n\r\nGits contains a cache file that keeps track of repo owner/name combinations for quicker cloning. By saving these combinations, the next time you run `gits <repo name>`, if anything in the cache matches `<repo name>`, gits will clone from GitHub without making a GET api search request.\r\n\r\n## ToDo\r\n\r\n* Add usage method `gits <repo name> all` to display the top 5 results from a search. User should be able to begin cloning by selecting 1-5.\r\n* Update the `<repo owner>/<repo name>` method to save combos to the cache file.\r\n* Better error handling.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n* MIT\r\n* Apache 2\r\n","name":"Gits","tagline":"A command line tool to clone GitHub repositories by name or owner/name."}
